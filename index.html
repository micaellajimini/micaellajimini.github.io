                <ul>
                    <li><b>Making 'Sudoku Game'(6/2015 - 6/2015) - C language</b><br/>
                        The project of C programming, using C language. I developed the program solving 'Sudoku'. The numbers are given by users, the blank in Sudoku is same to zero in the program. So the program change the number 0 to 1~9. The user can see results(answers) by output.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Making 'Renting Video Program'(12/2015 - 12/2015) - C language</b><br/>
                        I developed the program that manage registering, finding, renting and returning video and manage customer list, using C language. It was the project of C programming, which is school project.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Allocating Boxes at empty room(10/2015 - 10/2015) - C language</b><br/>
                        The room size, the number of boxes and the size of boxes are given by users. In the program, I allocate boxes as many as possible, rotating boxes. It was NP problem. It was designed using C language.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Making Virtual SIC/XE Machine(03/2017 - 05/2017) - C language</b><br/>
                        Using C, the school project of 'System Programming' making the virtual SIC/XE Machine. I implemented Assembler to generate 'obj file' from 'asm file'. I developed Linker and Loader to load the 'obj file' from 'asm file'. I developed Linker and Loader to load the 'obj file' to memory and Breakpoint also. The Breakpoint is for run, test or debug the programs on memory. By this project, I learned more about linker, loader and assembler.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>N-gram Language Model with AWS, Hadoop (05/2017 - 06/2017) - Python</b><br/>
                        From the text Data saved by AWS, I practiced the statistical analysis of association of words, using the Map-Reduce    
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Pintos Project(09/2017 - 12/2017) (Team Project) - C language</b><br/>
                        It was team project. For understanding the Operating System, we start Pintos project. We manage the projects by using Github. We implemented the works related to Threads, User Program, Synchronization, and Virtual Memory.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Accelerating calculation using CUDA C (11/2017 - 11/2017)- CUDA C</b><br/>
                        I implemented the parallel processing by GPU to accelerate matrix calculation processes and measure and compare each speed of methods storing data. By modifying algorithms and changing the GPU's memory, I find the optimal method for the parallel processing.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Controlling Robot escaping maze using Android phone controller(03/2017 - 06/2017) (Team Project) - JAVA</b><br/>
                        The team project, to control ev3 robot to escape maze. The robot escape maze by finding road and rotating when it encounter color walls. The user can control robot using android application. Our team was divided to 2 parts - making robot to escape maze, connecting robot and app to be able to control the robot. I was in second part. We manage this project using Github of one team member.
